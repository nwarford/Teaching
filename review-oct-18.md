# Content
- Can we review while loops? (Syntax difference, application)
  - see `whileLoopsPractice.py`

# Strategies
- How can we better organize our code, now that it is getting long?
  - Yes! Importing your own code is ok - see Lab 4 for examples and we'll practice a lot in Lab 8.
- How often should we use comments?
  - As much as you need to describe program flow (function defs, loops, etc.)
- How do you break the whole lab/problem into functions, like in Lab 5?
  - Think of functions as verbs - one discrete action, but that may have multiple steps
  - Test each function **before** using it elsewhere.
- Are there any particularly good ways to write pseudocode?
  - Write it in such a way that **someone else** could implement.
- I feel like I'm bothering people when I ask for help in lab - how do I not feel this way?

# Broader CS questions
- What's the most common language used in coding?
  - Python
  - Nuclear missile guidance systems are written in Python
- Why don't we use Python in CSCI 151?
- Where does code come from???
- What's the difference between CS and software development?
- How similar are languages to each other? How easy is it to switch?
- Do you think the benefits of AI are outweighing the damages to the planet?
